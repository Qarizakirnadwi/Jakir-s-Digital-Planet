    <h1>My Personal Life and Information</h1>
    <h2>My Journey Begins</h2>
    <p>
        My journey started on February 1, 1990, when I was born into a home where two remarkable personalities lived together—my father, Mr. Abdus Suban, and my mother, Mrs. Hajara Khatun, one of the greatest mothers in the world. Their home was situated in a small village named Kasokhaity, under P.O. Magurmari, District Nagaon (Assam), India.

My mother originally wished to name me Ismail Hussain, but destiny had other plans. My elder brother, Mr. Saiful Islam, spontaneously called me Jakir Hussain, and my father, respecting his wish, decided to officially name me Jakir Hussain from that day onward.

The name Jakir (Zakir) is of Arabic origin and means "remembering" or "grateful." It comes from the Arabic root word "ذكر", which means "to remember."

All my official certificates originally bore the name "Zakir Hussain" (starting with 'Z'), but an unexpected change occurred when I enrolled in school after completing my Alimiyat from <a href="https://www.nadwa.in/" target="_blank">Nadwatul Ulema.</a>  The school's principal and owner, Mr. Anuwar Hussain, mistakenly recorded my name as "Jakir Hussain" (starting with 'J') in the school register. From that point onward, all my academic certificates officially recognized me as "Jakir Hussain.
    </p>
    <h2>My Childhood and Family Background</h2>
    <p>
        As I remember, my childhood was blessed and peaceful because my mother is a very God-fearing person, and my father was an educated, well-experienced, polite, and firm individual with many admirable qualities.

My father belonged to a rich and well-structured landlord family. My grandfather owned nearly 40 acres of land in the 1930s, and he had three sons and five daughters. My father, being the youngest, lived a peaceful and prosperous life.

My father's eldest brother, Mr. Abdul High, expanded the family land to over 100 acres and became one of the most wealthy and well-known businessmen in our locality and beyond.
    </p>
    <h2>My Parents’ Wishes and My Passion for Qirat</h2>
    <p>
        My father wished for me to become an Islamic Alim (scholar), while my mother wanted me to become a Hafiz of the Holy Qur'an. However, I had my own passion: I wanted to become a great Qari of the Holy Qur'an.

My love for Qirat began in the 8th standard, when I first listened to the legendary Qari Abdul Basit’s recitation. By the grace of Allah, I was blessed with a beautiful voice for reciting the Qur’an, and this passion has continued to grow within me.

After completing my 8th standard in our village school, my father enrolled me in an institute where students were trained to become Hafiz of the Holy Qur'an, fulfilling my mother’s wish. At that time, I was around 12 years old. However, after a year, my father decided to change the institute, possibly because of my mischievous nature, which is natural for children at that age.
    </p>
    <h2>My Journey to Lucknow</h2>
    <p>
        From that moment, my journey took me to Lucknow, a city known for its Islamic scholars and influential personalities.

It was around 2003 when Mr. Kamal, a respected Hafiz & Qari of the Holy Qur'an, returned to our village after completing his studies in Lucknow. He greatly influenced the people of our area, inspiring many young students. Seeing his achievements, my father decided to entrust me to him, so he could take me to Lucknow and enroll me in the same Madrasa where he had studied.

It was one of the toughest and most challenging decisions my father made because, at that time, I was the only child at home who kept my family joyful with my mischievous acts. I was also their hope and support, bringing warmth and happiness to our home.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Leaving Home: A Heartbreaking Moment
    </h2>
    <p>
        The day I left home was an emotionally overwhelming moment. My mother started weeping a week before my departure, knowing that communication in those days was extremely difficult. Unlike today, when we have mobile phones and instant messaging, back then, the only means of communication was through letters, which took 4 to 5 days to arrive.

If something happened to me, my family would only find out after receiving a letter that I had written days earlier. In our village, there was only one telephone booth, and mobile phones were owned only by a few wealthy businessmen. One of my cousins, the younger son of Mr. Abdul High, had a Nokia mobile phone, but it had no camera or advanced features—just basic calling.

When the day arrived, my entire family gathered to bid me farewell. My father somehow managed to give me 5000 rupees, which was meant to support me for my first month in Lucknow. In those days, Lucknow was considered very far from our village, and traveling there was a big challenge.
    </p>
    <h2>First Time in Lucknow</h2>
    <p>
        Leaving for Lucknow was a huge step. Everything was new for me—the language, the culture, the food. In our village, even traveling to Guwahati for studies was considered a big deal, so moving to an entirely new city felt like stepping into another world.

After a two-day train journey, I finally reached Lucknow. It was my first train ride, and I was both excited and nervous. The date was November 25, 2004—a day that marked the beginning of a new chapter in my life.

When I arrived at Charbagh Railway Station at 5 AM, I was accompanied by and my classmate Mushfiqur Rahman. Mushfiqur later became a Hafiz of the Holy Qur’an, though he did not continue his studies further. Even today, he remains in touch with me and respects me deeply.

At that time, e-rickshaws didn’t exist. Instead, we had manual cycle rickshaws and auto-rickshaws. Kamal Bhai hired a man-pulled rickshaw, and we rode through the unfamiliar streets of Lucknow, finally reaching Ghanta Bagh, Godhiya—a well-known Muslim locality in Lucknow where Kamal Bhai was staying.

This is just the beginning of my journey in Lucknow. Many challenges, struggles, and lessons awaited me in the years to come...
